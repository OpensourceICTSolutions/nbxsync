# Support

As nbxSync bridges the gap between NetBox and Zabbix, questions may arise about how to fully use this plugin, or about specific NetBox/Zabbix features.

This plugin is developed and maintained by [Opensource ICT Solutions](https://www.oicts.com/r/6We). Our core business is Zabbix consultancy, and weâ€™ve chosen to open-source this plugin as a way to give back to the community.

We are committed to:

- Fixing bugs and keeping the plugin maintained.
- Answering general questions where possible and within reason.

Please note, however:

- We do not provide free consultancy.
- If you require guaranteed response times, in-depth assistance with your specific environment, or advice on NetBox or Zabbix configuration, this falls under [paid consultancy services](https://www.oicts.com/r/g2z).

In short: the plugin is free and open source; professional support and tailored consultancy are available as a paid service.
