## Description

nbxSync seamlessly integrates Netbox with Zabbix.

With nbxSync you can:
âœ… Create and manage all your devices in NetBox (your single source of truth)
âœ… Automatically sync devices to Zabbix for monitoring
âœ… Save time, reduce errors, and ensure consistent, up-to-date monitoring data

This plugin bridges the gap between network/source-of-truth documentation and infrastructure monitoring â€“ something many teams have been asking for.

ðŸ’¡ If youâ€™re running both NetBox and Zabbix, this is the missing link youâ€™ve been waiting for.
